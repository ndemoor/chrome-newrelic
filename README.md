# Chrome Extension: New Relic Server Annotation

New Relic only provides the hostname in the server list, which can get quite messy when you are monitoring lots of servers who don't necessarely report to an application.
This chrome extension provides functionality to add naming tags to your server list, making it easier to find the specific server you are looking for.

## Features

- Added an extra button in the top bar of the server list, to toggle adding name tags

- When clicking this button 'set name' buttons will appear next to every server
